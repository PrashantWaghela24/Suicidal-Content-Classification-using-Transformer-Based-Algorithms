As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands?

Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I‚Äôm so close to my limit . I‚Äôve been quiet for so long and I‚Äôm too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I‚Äôve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I‚Äôve experienced in life? Only time I‚Äôve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I‚Äôm still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.\\nI was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )\\nCome to find out as I‚Äôve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I‚Äôve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as ‚Äúhappiest she‚Äôs ever seen me, therapy has helped him‚Äù \\nI eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I‚Äôm sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I‚Äôve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I‚Äôve caused them even more. \\nNow here with everything going on, I‚Äôm as afraid as I‚Äôve ever been . I‚Äôve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What‚Äôs my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. \\nPlease Please Please someone.. anyone help me.\\nI‚Äôm so scared I might do something drastic, I‚Äôve been shaped by fear and anxiety.

But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.\\n\\nI know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head.

There is absolutely nothing for me.  I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever.  The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren.  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and she‚Äôs assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.\\n\\nShe made me feel accepted.  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth.  She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was.  But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I‚Äôve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.\\n\\nWe have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am.  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I don‚Äôt blame her.  I do nothing but hurt her these days.  None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasn‚Äôt.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.  \\n\\nFor about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn‚Äôt have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn‚Äôt have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn‚Äôt have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.\\n\\nI miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn‚Äôt leave my room for two weeks.  I didn‚Äôt eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.\\n\\nIt was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn‚Äôt happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don‚Äôt remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn‚Äôt believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn‚Äôt talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a ‚Äúred string of fate.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt believe in fate, but I also don‚Äôt think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I don‚Äôt have anything at all to give in a friendship.\\n\\nAfter fighting with Maren, and being told that I can‚Äôt keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.\\n\\nI am getting tired of writing, though.  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them.  I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them.  I am writing this because I now have zero friends.  I am completely alone.  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.\\n\\nGoodbye,\\n\\nSteven  ',\n",

Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.\\n\\nOne ring to rule them all.\\n\\nOne by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father‚Äôs sword.\\n\\nSauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.\\n\\nAnd some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.\\n\\nIt came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollum‚Äôs cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.\\n\\nFor the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.',\n",

But the main reasons are a combination: (Lack of) Economic Stability, Health Problems, Family\\nalong with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life.\\n\\n**Economic**:\\n\\nGrowing up was hard and I\\'ve had to overcome a lot of adversity (lower-income household, mother dying at\\na young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc), like a lot of people here.\\nI\\'m in college currently, but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major, college \\njust seems very oppressive. I know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial.\\nMy parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school\\nor even CC for a few years (I had relatively good grades in high school). I knew from the moment I was on campus\\nthat I hated it; lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, I didn\\'t have a good sense of direction\\nor idea for a major/career and never felt inspired. I thought about transferring, but didn\\'t have the \\nresources or finances (first-generation college student), so I stuck it out though I was depressed. I did well academically\\nbut since my major/department is kinda shitty (applied math), I\\'m worried that I won\\'t get a good paying job, unlike\\nengineering students. Like had I known earlier, I would have just majored in that instead. I will leave college\\nnext year with about 25-28K in loans.\\n\\n**Family**:\\n\\nGenerally, I strongly dislike my family life. My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house\\nas fast as they could. My mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming\\nself-sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife (unemployed) and kids, even though he\\'s pretty old\\nand should be focusing on retirement. I haven\\'t come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it.\\n(not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family-oriented). My parents are also immigrants so we don\\'t have\\ntons of wealthy family here.\\n\\n**Health**:\\nI have a lot of chronic, probably genetically-caused, health diseases since I was young.\\nWhen I was young and in my mid-teens, I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive.\\nAfter my mom died, my dad didn\\'t bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists\\nanymore, my health has decreased. It\\'s hard at college too, because I don\\'t have a car, and I didn\\'t always have\\nhealth insurance to be able to see anyone. So my health continues to decrease. These aren\\'t\\nlife-threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self-conscious.\\n\\nSo because of all this, I find it hard to justify continuing life. I am kind of a nihilist and definitely \\nan atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife. I don\\'t want to kill myself yet, but in 3-4 years,\\nwhen I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide-planning once I\\'m in the \"real world\".\\nI\\'ve seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even.\\nIt seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first-generation college student background with severly\\nlimited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years. And it\\'s\\nhard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper-middle class families succeed in life, when it\\'s a\\nconstant struggle for me.And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what\\'s the point? Why suffer and\\nstruggle so much in life if I don\\'t really see a reason too? Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed\\nwith me and is truly planning suicide in the future.I\\'m also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or\\nexpanding on the reasons above, though I doubt people can change my mind.\\n\\nTL:DR: Want to wait 3-4 years before committing suicide. Basically I personally see life worth living if\\nI\\'m economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy. However, for a multitude of complex\\nreasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me.

I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.\\n\\nI wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. \\n\\nBut today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people  see that too. Especially people who know what its like.\\n\\nI know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.\\n\\nAnother complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?\\n\\nSomeone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.\\n\\nMy life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).\\n\\nI know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it.\",\n",

Lately I‚Äôve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I‚Äôve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I‚Äôve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there‚Äôs definitely something wrong.\\n\\nTo further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I‚Äôve tried to cut and with such force and pressure.

I obviously didn‚Äôt do this, and even if I were to walk out, I‚Äôd probably wouldn‚Äôt because I felt like if I did, I‚Äôd just spread my suffering to my family. \\n\\nAbout my family : As I stated previously, they‚Äôre an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I‚Äôll be honest, it‚Äôs hard sometimes but I feel no sense of ‚Äúselfness‚Äù I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn‚Äôt even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn‚Äôt exist.

I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it‚Äôs never going to happen, I don‚Äôt even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can‚Äôt just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can‚Äôt help but feeling so fucking bad.\\n\\nI am scared that I‚Äôm going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I‚Äôve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5\\nYears no, but in the past 4 months, I genuinely have been feeling this way daily and very recently have had only suicide on my mind.

It wasn\\'t really news, I\\'ve known I\\'ve been depressed for years (approaching 3 1/2 years now). I got prescribed Zoloft, and I\\'m up to 75mg now. I\\'ve also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now. Its not working though. If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it\\'s not even getting worse at a slower rate.\\n\\nOver the last few years I\\'ve made a lot of changes to try to help. I went from 198 to 150, I started eating healthier, I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, I transferred colleges since the first one wasn\\'t working out, I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, I even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything. Now I\\'ve finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric.\\n\\nAnd none of it has helped. If anything, its only gotten worse since I don\\'t even have the hope that any more changes will help. The hope is gone. When I was a kid, I used to get Pneumonia a lot. I had it like 5 times before I was 3. I wish I\\'d have just died back then, I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me.\\n\\nThe latest \"I think I would be happy if...\" thing has been getting in a relationship. I think I\\'m thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes I haven\\'t yet made, and because I pretty genuinely hate myself (I\\'ve pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA, I don\\'t really believe in inherent self-worth). I\\'m almost 21 now and haven\\'t ever been on a date, let alone received a non-platonic hug. Nobody ever expresses interest in me, I always have to initiate (thought I\\'ve found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if I don\\'t initiate I\\'d never get invited to anything). I can\\'t even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit. It\\'s not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to. It feels like all the changes I\\'ve made over the years have amounted to nothing.\\n\\nI\\'m just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time. I haven\\'t been able to cry in years, so I just self harm when I feel like crying. It\\'s not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn\\'t give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense. Besides, it beats drinking heavily like most \\'normal\\' people my age do (though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk).\\n\\nAll my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers. It feels like I\\'ve gotten left behind on the road of life. Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I\\'ve started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I\\'m trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that\\'s all I ever get \"I\\'m sure you\\'ll find someone eventually.\" Thing is, none of the \"I\\'d might be happy if...\" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.\\n\\nI don\\'t enjoy anything anymore. Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores, EU4 is too frustrating now. I\\'ve already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through. I don\\'t enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year. I don\\'t have any shows I really enjoy. I\\'ve always wanted to learn to draw, I\\'m actually a huge fan of furry art, but I\\'m pretty bad and I\\'m a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can\\'t do it and get better.\\n\\nSuicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with \"get better\" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I\\'d be better off. I used to think \"Ok, I\\'ll wait until I turn 30, and then I\\'ll kill myself if things haven\\'t improved.\" However, as things have deteriorated, I\\'ve moved that up to 25. More recently, I\\'ve moved it up to after graduation (I\\'m thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don\\'t even know how I\\'m going to make it that far. Suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something I have to do.\\n\\nI don\\'t buy the whole \"it gets better\" thing anymore. Its been over 3 years. It really doesn\\'t in my experience. All the medical advice I\\'ve been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself. I don\\'t understand to what end though? Like, if I don\\'t kill myself now, then what? I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is \"why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?\" I don\\'t see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I\\'ll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I\\'m gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don\\'t have to hurt anymore, people who love me don\\'t have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I\\'ve been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up.

It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and real‚Ä¶ Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and you‚Äôre lying in bed wondering.\\n\\n\\n‚ÄúDid I just wake up‚Ä¶ or just fall asleep.‚Äù\\n\\n\\nThe fragments don‚Äôt seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.\\n\\n\\nIn these dreams, I‚Äôve seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.\\n\\n\\nIt took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and I‚Äôm forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasn‚Äôt until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. I‚Äôve cousins who experience the same. We‚Äôve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn‚Äôt understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\nOut of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.\\n\\n\\nI‚Äôve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasn‚Äôt going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I can‚Äôt say for certain why I chose 27‚Ä¶ Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except I‚Äôm far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, I‚Äôve always just been drawn to it.\\n\\n\\nWhen my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan I‚Äôd concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\nIt began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where I‚Äôm a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who‚Äôs aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.\\n\\n\\nWe fixate on negatives, humans that is. It‚Äôs an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. I‚Äôm far from being a master at this myself.\\n\\n\\n‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?‚Äù\\n\\n\\nIs it because that‚Äôs when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?\\n\\n\\nOr is it something more positive‚Ä¶ Does the family‚Äôs clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?\\n\\n\\nMaybe we aren‚Äôt clairvoyant. Odds are it‚Äôs just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. I‚Äôve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.\\n\\n\\nIs it going to end at 29‚Ä¶ am I going to see the other side of 30? If I don‚Äôt, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe I‚Äôm not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.\\n\\n\\nI don‚Äôt make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I can‚Äôt say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.\\n\\n\\n‚ÄúHow would she react?‚Äù\\n\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat would the funeral look like?‚Äù\\n\\n\\nHow many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for ages‚Ä¶ Likely never settling back down into their original position.\\n\\n\\nThat‚Äôs the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.\\n\\n\\nIt has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know I‚Äôve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So I‚Äôve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.\\n\\n\\nWithin the next two months am I going to finally disregard others‚Äô feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, I‚Äôm not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.\\n\\n\\nWith some luck, maybe‚Ä¶ Just maybe 29 isn‚Äôt the end‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just a new beginning.\\n',\n",

              " \"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick. During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.\\n\\nIn the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.\\n\\nAnyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.\\n\\nThe second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.\\n\\nFinally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.\\n\\nPerhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.\\n\\nMy brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.\\n\\nWith regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.\\n\\nAfter leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.\\n\\nSurely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?\\n\\nAt first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn‚Äôt and actually it‚Äôs just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn‚Äôt feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would‚Äôve if I‚Äôd done anything wrong.\\n\\nThings have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.\\n\\nBut even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.\\n\\nI worry that I might, out of a morbid curiosity, have done it. I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it, and then - as far as I know - not doing it.\",\n",

I used to have strong believes about life, politics, relationships (I\\'m an atheist), and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind. \\n\\nTurkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities, and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible; muslim-heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire, wannabe \"highly cultural\" social media slaves/plaza workers, bigheaded academics who doesn\\'t give a shit about their thesis student, women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men, people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have. \\n\\nFuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in, I am so sorry people. I wish English was my mother tongue, but it isn\\'t and I am not confident the way I express myself. \\n\\nThis life, is too complicating, too demanding, too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey. I want to leave here, but I don\\'t know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country. Here, I am an intellectual, succesfull computer engineer; outside of Turkey, I am a fucking roach. I\\'ve sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country. Noone wants me. How do I escape here? Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life? Would it worth the effort? I don\\'t know.\\n\\nDeath, seems like such a sweet release to me. I just want to die, naturally, at this moment, in an instant. I had enough. I had my peak  at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it. I\\'ve been depressed before, even got some medical treatment for it. It doesn\\'t feel like being depressed at all. It is just... there is no meaning in anything at all. We are bunch of atoms. Dying will just stop all of it. I wouldn\\'t care for anyone and anything If I was dead. I wouldn\\'t be upset about the fact that I could do much, have children and stuff. Dead doesn\\'t care. Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable. ',\n",

However, it is one that is weighing on me and I feel so low that I want to die. I\\'m a 30 year old woman and have never been \"lucky\" when it comes to dating or relations, however I met someone last year that I felt I connected with. We had so much fun together and I loved to be around him, and we \"dated\" but I felt like I was not good enough to be his girlfriend. He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like \"I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend\" or \\'you would be the perfect girlfriend\". At the same time he would brush off discussions I\\'ve tried to have about relationships and would say \"you deserve a nice boyfriend\" and things like that. The whole ordeal made me feel awful about myself and I have been in such a depression. We still text but I don\\'t try to have serious conversations anymore since he moved for his job anyways. I feel like a fucking idiot for putting myself in this position but I don\\'t see any hope.',\n",

I love him so much, our 4 year anniversary is coming up on February 14. I got him his gift and it\\'s currently in transit. I just wanted to say he\\'s literally the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn\\'t be the person I am today without him. I... live in an extremely toxic home, and I hate it, I\\'m not allowed to date but I don\\'t care, I fell in love with someone, and we\\'ve been together almost 4 years now. He\\'s so amazing...He\\'s so kind, and charming, and passionate, and loving, and willing, and handsome and cute and literally any positive thing you can think of. He has no flaws. He\\'s so perfect in my eyes. He\\'s been there for me when literally no-one else has.  I couldn\\'t be more thankful. I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we\\'ve been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR\\'s silly, but he\\'s my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that\\'s alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that\\'s all I really need. He\\'s literally my best friend. He\\'s been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn\\'t much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don\\'t really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it\\'s rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I\\'ve been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He\\'s so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I\\'m feeling even if I don\\'t tell him initially. He tells me he\\'s proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I\\'ve been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it\\'s so silly to think that you\\'re first relationship is the one you\\'re gonna marry. But I so truly believe he\\'ll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven\\'t felt sad, like \"unneeded\" sad, of course I have days, but he\\'s literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my \"spark\". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don\\'t think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he\\'s done...I\\'m overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or \"I know I\\'m all these things, but so are you\" He knows me, he knows who I am, he\\'s the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can\\'t love right now.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI think I\\'ll stop there for now, I could novels upon novels about my love for him, but I think now is a good time to stop.

We were both insanely depressed, I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse. I miss him so much it hurts. He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard he‚Äôs doing better but I‚Äôve decided to go no contact, but I miss him so bad maybe I‚Äôll do minimal contact once he‚Äôs feeling better.. I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but it‚Äôs gone out of control since moving back home. My life has no direction or meaning. All I do is bother everyone. My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus. Getting out of bed is insanely difficult. Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me, I know it‚Äôs my head playing with me man. I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it. It‚Äôs hard making friends and I don‚Äôt want to bother my friends down here. \\n\\nI had a decent job paying me 15 an hour but it was insanely stressful, when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me 10 dollars an hour. It‚Äôs definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me. My thoughts eat my alive.\\n\\nI hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel 10x worse. The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end. We smoked after and chatted for a bit. Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep, well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours. It felt so good to be high again. Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore, I got no sleep, and my emotions are completely out of control. I‚Äôm usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day. \\n\\nHousekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there. I told them to call them because I was busy, but they stood behind me for 10 minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because they‚Äôre english is bad and they wanted me to do it... they were communicating with me just fine. So I snapped and said ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do?! Did y‚Äôall call them like i told you?‚Äù they said they called the gm and my boss but they didn‚Äôt answer their phones and they left a voicemail. So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier, and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss, so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her. I said I only called her because him and the other boss didn‚Äôt answer their phones, and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldn‚Äôt tell us to call them whenever they aren‚Äôt there if we need help if they don‚Äôt want to help. So what‚Äôs the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board, I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I can‚Äôt help them and to please go away.\\n\\nI had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling. It wasn‚Äôt meant to be a suicide note, but I did mention how I wanted to do it. Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested, I want to drive far away listening to music until I‚Äôm tired, then I want to drive into a body of water and drown. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work. I‚Äôm too coward to shoot myself or hang myself. I don‚Äôt want my family to find me. If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees. I thought I closed the word document, but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasn‚Äôt attached to my body. So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at 11:55 last night and I‚Äôm wondering if that is why. Why else call me at that hour. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking. \\n\\nSo now I‚Äôm thinking should I not show up to work? Maybe have a me day? I don‚Äôt even know how to have a self care and love day.

I understand we\\'re all trapped in our own heads, but I\\'ve never felt so tethered down like I have by this awful, sickly feeling that has been plaguing my thinking nonstop the past five days.  I know, I know, nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them - but dang, I\\'m not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often.  At all.  So when I do, and I know I\\'m not doing well, it feels like I\\'m missing an incredibly important game changer for my life.  Yet, here I am again.  Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything.  And this one going wrong is just another lump.  Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me.  Another nail in the coffin, as it were.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior.  I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job, and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties.  And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl...holy crap, I\\'m an idiot.  And a creep.  Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago, and, during one of our drunken conversations, she told me how I was like \"a little brother\" to her.  Of course, this makes my heart swell with pure joy, but then I wonder how creepy does that make me?  I\\'m just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy.  The past two nights, I\\'d go out drinking and just tell myself (aloud unfortunately) how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with.  It upsets my friends who were drinking with me.  They genuinely do care, but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too.  Who can blame them?  It\\'s terrible.  And the more I think about it, the worse I get.  And the worse I get, the more I think about it.  My descent into pure, unadulterated, 100% self hatred is nearly complete.

Yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so I stopped asking for help altogether. \\n\\nFrom that point on, almost everything I did was on my own. I would start to fear help itself so I would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that I was studying just to avoid help altogether. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t just with studying.

The point being is that I haven\\'t had anything since my first initial outbreak two years ago. Combine this fact along with the fact that I thought 80% of the population already had it, and that it was very rare to give it when you do not have symptoms. I was wrong. Only 60% of the US population has it (40% is far to high for me to just not care), and you can fairly regularly give it when you have no symptoms. So, now, if I ever want to kiss a girl again, I have to warn her that I\\'ve had cold sores, and I also need to avoid oral sex because I might give my partner it down there even without any open sores. \\n\\nSo, this news is too much for me. I\\'m already miserable at my job (I\\'ve been looking for new work for three months now--my city\\'s economy is horrible).

I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not, wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head. I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic. Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it's almost no wonder they do. But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy, so easy compared to most people's it's pathetic. I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day. The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up. Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood. But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering. And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant. So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time. So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn't awful? I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I'm real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I'll die. I just feel so lost, I am trying to find a path in life where I am not doomed to suffer the majority of the time and live for those small bits of time where I can do what I please. I want to live for what I like all the time but I'm afraid that's too greedy, too much to ask for, the majority of people don't how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence? Does it even exist? Am I chasing after something that can never be attained? And if that's the case how do I endure the suffering? Because I feel like I am weaker than the majority I am pathetic when compared to the majority. People have endured so much more than I have yet they still have the will to move forward when I am here wallowing in despair over the inevitable suffering I will face in the future.

I have wealthy parents who always loved and supported me and pushed me to do the best in life. I have a girlfriend of 2 years who I love so much. I worked in Canary Wharf ( UK Version of Wall Street ) as a foreign exchange broker for over a year and I was pretty good at it. I left that job a few days after I turned 21 to start my own brokerage. I have a group of friends who are always there for each other, my friends are my second family. We always have each other‚Äôs backs. My life should be perfect ya know. Middle class white boy with his entire life in front of him. Then it changed.\\n\\nA few months ago I was involved in a car accident with a cyclist. I was driving home from my girlfriends on Mother‚Äôs Day and just didn‚Äôt see them. I missed the first one somehow but hit the front cyclist. They died a week later in hospital. In a few weeks, after the police have concluded their investigation I am going to charged with Death by Dangerous Driving. It carries a minimum of 2 years in prison and a lengthy driving ban. Due to coronavirus the firm helping me setup my own brokerage has folded, I lost all the money  I had already invested into my firm from website design and the such, which was pretty much everything I had. My girlfriend is leaving me due to the fact I‚Äôm going to prison for 2+ years. She‚Äôs also leaving me for a guy she works with, turns out they‚Äôve been having an affair since early December... and he sexually assaulted her. Apparently I‚Äôm just that bad of a boyfriend she wants to leave me for someone who sexually assaulted her. Most of my friends no longer talk to me due to the accident and the stress of the entire situation is putting a huge strain on my dads already very weak heart. My mum cries most morning and nights over it. \\n\\nI‚Äôve always felt like I was a burden on people my entire life. I feel like I‚Äôve let people down my entire life. I wish I could be someone different. My brother for example. He is a national swimmer, he has a masters degree in motorsport engineering and is currently an assistant lecturer. He has a house he rents with his friend in Coventry. My parents were always so proud of him. Although I said earlier that my parents loved me and supported me they have never been proud of me. They found out I smoked in year 9, I was never part of a sports team in school, I wasn‚Äôt popular. They felt I wasted my potential playing video games and going out with the few friends I had. \\n\\nSo basically I‚Äôve decided to end it. My entire life I‚Äôve let people down, disappointed people and now everything is falling apart around me. I‚Äôve lost my friends, my girlfriend, my company and soon I‚Äôm going to lose my freedom. I had everything and now I have nothing. I used to be sure of everything and where I wanted to go in life, I wanted to bring my friends and family and girlfriend along with me. \\n\\nNow it‚Äôs just me. Alone in the dark, lying in bed at 1:42am on a Tuesday morning.

I spent 3 years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights, drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking. One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka. I don't remember much about that night. I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible. I woke up to a trashed apartment. I gave my landlord my 30 day notice, submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job, told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me (for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with) and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse. I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good. I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier.\\n\\nI made a miscalculation though. I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody. Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers, supervisors, and politics I had to deal with. I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this. We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust. I'm afraid to tell her anything now because I'm afraid I'll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking.\\n\\nI'm in the same rut I was before, I feel desperately alone and depressed. The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months. Its hard to not beat yourself up when you've lived alone, isolated from about a dozen people for three years.\\n\\n I feel like all my hard work has been futile now. I stopped going to the gym, I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape. (The constant introspection began to drive me mad.). I feel like nothing has changed. I'm still miserable and I'm still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker. I haven't felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment.

I don't experience the very common triggers, nor do I experience the physiological and emotional extremes associated with that disorder. It's all a misdiagnosis. I know it. I don't care if three doctors agreed with it, it's all wrong. These are the wrong meds and they are going to ruin me.\\n\\nThe thoughts came back. I keep going through almost cyclical periods of wanting to go through with a gender transition, only to completely lose interest weeks or months later. I don't know which side to trust. I was going through treatment for it, but I ended up quitting for some stupid fucking reason. Now it's flaring up again. When it flares up now, it flares up to an EXTREME extent. I can't make rational decisions, my emotions are very unstable, and I become suicidal and engage in self-harm. These periods can last from a week to a few months. I don't understand why it's so intense. I literally cannot focus on ANYTHING else besides the idea of transitioning. The thoughts plague me night and day. It haunts me in my sleep.

There is no other option.\\n\\nI won't be able to transition in the near future. By then the treatment will have a minimized effect on me. I was fine before this two years ago. It worked. I was fine.

I'm told I shouldn't expect to be able to sustain a real 9-5 job that pays well. It's either part-time min wage servitude or disability. Either way I won't be able to pursue the gender transition.

I always considered myself to not have to worry about the scenario until I was in my 30's, but here I am dealing with it at the age of 19. I've been criticized and pointed out at how well I'm coping with all of this happening for me, but deep down inside I'm hurt like the rest of them, I'm just desensitized from all the quarrels, problems, and depression leading up to it, not to mention nightmares almost every single night since then.\\n\\nIt used to be just my mother, myself, and my brother all living together. My father left because of a relationship dispute some time ago when I was younger, but he has still been there for me. But since this has all happened, it has felt like nothing but control over the situation. He doesn't want to support me and my brother financially while he's the only one with a job right now, and he can't support us socially because he lives in another city. The most he's done is tell us to get a job and start manning up to the responsibilities that my mother used to take care of, but to be fair, neither me or my brother have had the willpower to do anything since. I want to go and see a grievance counselor with my brother, but procrastination, depression, and anxiety has been getting the better of both of us, and I doubt my father would be willing to help in that regard.\\n\\nI feel really broken right now. Unable to work and keep up in today's society. Everyone's pushing us forward, telling us what to do, how to do, what we need. I feel it's only a matter of time before either me or my brother hatches an idea and it plays out like some sort of dramatic movie. I asked my brother today how is he feeling today, on a scale from 0 being like any other day, to 10 being that he knows today is his last. He replied 8, I replied 6, although that's probably just the desensitization talking, and I'm probably more closer to 8 or 9.\\n\\nI feel like this is all revolving around money. It doesn't feel right at all, especially considering that my mother used to get paid spousal support, and she'd spend that money on me and my brother. It now goes all back to my dad and haven't seen anything since. I've tried speaking up against my dad about this, but the most he does is hold what little he supports us on right now over our heads and asks if we want his support or not.\\n\\nI don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to live. I definitely don't know how to help myself. A lot of these things, I would have asked my mother to hold my hand and help me do them. She would give me so much support through it until I was able to do it myself, but now all I get is tough love.\",\n",

But if it's the only thing I can think about, where do I go from here?I cross-posted from r/depression. I'm sorry if you see this twice. \\n\\nI've been lurking here on my main for a long time, and I don't know that I fit in. I'm sorry if my situation isn't relatable. It sounds really stupid.\\n\\nI have a great life. I know many people are alone but I'm not, no matter how much I keep trying to be. I try to push my friends and family away but I can't. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazing.\\n\\nSuicide is absolutely not an option for me. I have too many people who care about me (I know, I know how this sounds). Once my dad and grandma pass away, then it's very much on the table - friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it. However, my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy, I've got a couple decades before that becomes a reality. Sometimes I resent that, and that's the darkest thought I've ever had. I've never told anyone this before, but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad - my favorite person in the *world* \\\\- is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way, because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too, and I really don't want to.\\n\\nI'm also gainfully employed, in a job I used to love, and really should still love. I'm not wealthy but I can support myself. My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people, my boss is a good person, I believe in the work, and it pays the bills even in my very expensive city.\\n\\nI have friends, and the ability to have more friends, but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people away.\\n\\nI just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I have to keep it all up - working, being a normal person, or faking it as best as possible. I isolate myself a lot, I never go out, but still my friends are there. It's very weird and confusing. I don't know how I got so lucky. Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them, but they're all very cool people - they're intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives. I don't know how I've tricked all these people into being my friends, or how I've tricked my job into keeping me employed, or how I've tricked my family into being so supportive. But I have, and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyone.\\n\\nI don't want to be alive anymore. Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks. Every time I'm alone, and I'm alone *a lot,* all the same. But I don't know what to do. I feel so fucking trapped. But my amazing, supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this - and they'd probably have me committed. They'd probably try to make me quit my stressful job, as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job (which is stressful, yeah, but a mentally healthy person could handle this - hell, even a slightly-more-healthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it). Then I'd have nowhere to go, nothing to do. My friends and family would get tired of me and I'd be in the same situation as so many people who are alone.\\n\\nIt's like I've got it backwards. I have no reason to be depressed right now, but I am, cripplingly so. But if I tell anyone, my life will be turned upside down and I'll have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was 12.\\n\\nI just... don't know where to go from here. I'm sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow. And I'm sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging - I don't understand why I've gotten so unfairly lucky in life, either. I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them. I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me. I know that sounds awful.\",\n",

I once thought that human problems were surmountable, but they're not. \\n\\nThey're just not. I only want to live if I can think of a scheme in which humans aren't doomed, and I can't. I've tried and I can't, and that depresses me. Everyone I've ever loved is going to die; I'm going to die. Everyone works hard for things, which they forget about when they die. Everyone feels pain. There's so much agony in the world. So much madness. Small animals by the millions are being poured into grinders alive; their meat comes flowing out a tube, like shit from an anus. Young children are beheading people, but tiny baby arms are so weak they saw the heads off slowly. And then other children listen to music that's merely people screaming. Screaming! This is a world of endless screaming. High-school graduations happen, and the young men and women without scholarships walk away, knowing that they will live lives of struggle, which will be harvested as tax dollars for the state, no differently than the way human batteries are harvested by the machines of The Matrix. The planet is suffering and the minds able to come up with schemes capable of reversing the damage being done are killing themselves. The leaders we elect have values, not plans or schemes. Human history is filled with torture, slavery, and suffering. I hate being human. Most of my friends are depressed because I find happiness intolerable: pathological happiness in the face of this worlds past, present, and future, seems like a crime to me. Every religion secretly prescribes nihilism. Humans exploit one another in life, because nature has been overridden by the state, thanks to human nature. And I feel worlds away from it all. I don't want to participate in human affairs, but go in direction completely opposite to wherever this leads. I don't have any hope for humans... I just hope... That this is all some kind of simulation, intended to teach me how not to behave. What if evolution made us miserable, so we could survive? I don't feel like anyone can relate to me. I don't feel human. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do for you. I don't understand why, as I've aged, I've become more sensitive, and not less. The adults who raised me were so stupid, that I assumed I would become numb when I grew old, but it seems like the complete opposite has happened. These feelings. Was I programmed to function in a smaller world? I drive down the street, and it scares me: that I have this urge to meet everybody I see, but I roll past them like they're nothing. And I'm nothing too. What's the point in being a nothing that feels something? And there's no such thing as help. People don't help; they help themselves by getting jobs. One of my only older friends, she's really jaded about life; she feels like it let her down. She told me that I should try not to obsess over these things (our world and universe is eating itself); that people who do, do end up killing themselves. I just can't though. It's getting harder and harder to wake up in the morning, and when I do wake up I'll go back to bed to cover up my disgusting self. I will delete this post, to cover up my disgusting self, but I promise I won't kill myself. I feel so torn, because I want to like existence, but I don't. And it's the only existence I know!

I know its probably PPD and PPA but to be fucking honest, I dont care WHAT it is. All I know is I want it to stop. I dont enjoy being a mother. I got pregnant at 19. Just recently had my 21st bday. So I'm a young mom. I kept the baby because I thought I was going to be a good mom. I've worked at daycares. I've always been good w kids. I always wanted to be a mother. And I LOVE my baby, with all my heart, but I'm just not a good mom. I hate not being able to do anything anymore. Always broke. Cant even shit on my own time. I dont sleep. My baby is 9 mo old and still wakes up up to 8 times a night. I dont like my appearance. I don't like sitting home all day. I dont like the sound of my baby crying. I don't like changing 10000 diapers a day. I don't like not being able to do ANYTHING when I want to. I miss independence. Freedom. Having a personality other than tired and stressed. Friends. Going out. Relaxing. Having goals and hopes for my future. Lmao, all the goals I had are gone now. Cant go to college when all your money is being spent on formula. Cant go to college when you dont have a babysitter. Cant get a good job without college. Etc etc etc. I'll amount to nothing more than a mother now. And for some people that's enough. But I feel like I may as well be 50 already, just say bye to any semblance of youth i have. I don't think its right to my daughter to have a mom who doesnt wanna be here. I don't think it's fair to my boyfriend to have to deal with me. I will NEVER be happy away from her so leaving and starting over isnt an option. Cant undo my baby in my brain. But I will never be happy doing this either. I just want to quit. I want to die. I want her to have a better mom. I want her to not see anger from her mother. I want to not be conscious or aware anymore. I want to cease to be. But I'm terrified I'll do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar. If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death, I'd have done it long before now. And I've struggled w depression, bi polar, borderline personality, my whole life. I don't see it getting better. Just worse. So why stick around?\",\n",

In the United States, National Waffle Day is celebrated in August to commemorate the date of a U.S. patent on a waffle iron; however the celebration is described as \"at best a \\'bizarre\\' or \\'unique\\' holiday ‚Äì the fluff stuff of radio DJ commentary\", a frequent criticism of food celebration days.

So, I asked him if he could please, just please, come over here, instead of having that stupid fucking party. But guess what, he'd rather be there ofc. He'll maybe come later tonight, around 11pm, just to fuck obviously. I know he's totally obsessed with the girls that are gonna come to that party ('I just think they're really interesting', yeeah well, especially with those seethrough dresses and giant push-up bras, right.), and it just hurts so much. I never felt wanted in my entire life, and even he, after all this time, won't spend time with me. He's probably gonna break up with me soon cause I'm a depressed, hidious piece of shit with no friends who's always yelling and ruining everything. \\n\\nThings were finally getting better for me; I quit drugs after using almost half of my life, I started to eat better and to exercise, but nothing helps.

I‚Äôve considered it a lot of times in my life and I always come up with some reason not to. My family needs me too much. I‚Äôd miss the new episode of my favorite show. For the longest time, the reason I was holding onto was that I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on Avengers Infinity War and then Endgame. It sounds so stupid now that I think about it. Then I saw it and, even though it wasn‚Äôt everything I thought it was going to be, I was mostly satisfied, and I forgot. It had been so long that I had forgotten that I was waiting for that movie to end things.\\n\\nIt wasn‚Äôt until today when I was sitting on the couch, at peace for once. I was genuinely content with myself at that moment. Then my sister came, and she was mad that I didn‚Äôt take her son to school today. He didn‚Äôt get a lot of sleep last night, had a really bad nightmare about his grandmother (on his father\\'s side) who had recently passed. I decided to let him stay home since it wouldn‚Äôt be right to send him to school. My sister confronted me. She accused me of being lazy. She said that all I do is lay around and watch tv all the time. She brought up things; how I‚Äôd never finished school, how I didn‚Äôt have a job, how I didn‚Äôt have any friends, and that the only thing I had in this world was those stupid action figures that I collected. She called me a Worthless Bastard and said that I was going to grow old with nothing and that I better not expect her to take care of me when our mother eventually dies.\\n\\nA worthless bastard. That really hurt. She thinks that I am a worthless bastard. My own sister. I waited until she left the house and then I cried. I really got to thinking about my life.\\n\\nShe\\'s right. I don\\'t have any friends. I dropped out of college to take care of my mom when she got sick and now I don\\'t have a degree. I\\'m 23 and still a virgin. I\\'ve never even had a boyfriend cause no one ever wanted to ask me out. I was a home care provider for my mom but then I was fired when she changed insurances. No Job. No money. I fill out an application for places and get rejected. I go in for interviews and get rejected. I\\'m so tired of getting rejected.\\n\\nI just hate my life. I hate everything about it. Every time I leave the house I just feel like everyone is laughing at me. They can all see how awful I am and are thinking about how much they hate me. I know I\\'m being irrational. It\\'s just how I feel so I haven\\'t left the house, other than to drop my nephew off at school and pick him up, in days and even then I don\\'t get out of the car that way I don\\'t have to face anyone. I just go home and hide.\\n\\nI used to be so Smart. I think about how Smart I used to be. I think about my goals. My plans for my life. The things that I wanted to do. I was going to be a doctor. I was going to go to college out of state and It was my plan and I‚Äôd tell anyone who would listen about my plans.\\n\\nI endured a lot of bullying growing up and people were always telling me that I was worthless. I was always going to be worthless. I remember in the first grade that I was excluded from games and I didn‚Äôt have any friends. The Bullying continued throughout Elementary and Middle School. Bullied at school and then bullied at home by my sister and my grandmother. All my life everyone has always told me that I was ugly. that I was stupid. That I was lazy. That I couldn\\'t do anything right. That I was a dumbass. And whenever I\\'d cry I was called out for being sensitive. Why was I so sensitive? Why couldn‚Äôt I take a joke?  I was always a target, and there were days when I considered killing myself just for relief. But I didn‚Äôt. I stood in front of a mirror, tears in my eyes and I said, ‚ÄúNot yet. I can‚Äôt do that to my family.‚Äù\\n\\nBut I think about it now that I‚Äôm older. All my life, I was told that I had to take care of my sister. She has a mental disorder and my mom was always telling me that one day when I became a doctor that I had to support my sister. Look after her. I used to have nightmares about that. Nightmares where my mom was a ghost telling me to look after my sister. And after she had my nephew it became, \"Look after both of them.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m nothing. I didn\\'t become anything.

              " 'Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys, I am in a tough place right now. \\n\\nQuick background on me: I have moderate-severe clinical depression. Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation; before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time. I self-harmed every day. My symptoms are *completely managed* by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts. \\n\\nI just started dating someone (trans nonbinary, assigned female at birth) who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don\\'t enter the planning/methods level of detail, which is good. \\n\\nI am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren\\'t medically accurate, and relies on me to be their \"antidepressant.\" (I make them feel good when we see each other.) Obviously, I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship, but my SO\\'s refusal to get medical care for their depression/using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health. \\n\\nThey got upset at me (over text) when I said I couldn\\'t meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week (I am in a very involved premed program). \\n\\nThey live about 90 minutes away, so most of our communication is via text/video calls. A couple nights ago we had this exchange: \\n\\nSO: I want to die \\n\\nme: Do you think you\\'re going to hurt yourself tonight? \\n\\nSO: I\\'m already hurting myself \\n\\nme (at this point, shaking because I am upset and afraid they\\'re attempting suicide/self-harming): How? \\n\\nSO: I\\'m trying to write an essay, I can\\'t type both. \\n\\nA similar scenario has gone down a couple times; my SO saying they want to die/\"end my suffering\"/\"end me\" and then when I try to figure out what\\'s going on, I\\'m called a \"nerd\" or told \"stop worrying about me\" (harshly) or even just ignored. One time, they said they wanted to kill themselves, I responded saying something like, there are other ways to make the pain get better, what can I do for you, and was met with \"what are you going to do if I kill myself, spank me?\" \\n\\nThat message honestly made me sick to my stomach. \\n\\nI really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me. I understand what it\\'s like to be in that dark, awful place but I feel like I\\'m being played with, especially with the suicidal comments that, when I inquire about them, I am met with sarcasm or teasing. It is hurting me. I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so. \\n\\nWhat should I do, you guys? I don‚Äôt know what is going on, I don‚Äôt know if my SO is being serious or messing with me, I don‚Äôt know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage, and I don‚Äôt know if I should stay with them if this continues‚Äînot because they have depression, but because they won‚Äôt address it, against the advice of numerous medical professionals. \\nWe‚Äôve only been together a month. I really like them and am willing to be there for support, but I‚Äôm not an antidepressant. I‚Äôm a person with needs and a history of severe depression. I really don‚Äôt want to fall back into hurting myself. Please help me figure out how to navigate this. \\n',\n",

The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown, with difficulty I partially told her my \"dream\", why I want it, and why it\\'s so important to me, and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a crime or anything like that, but it\\'s something I feel is ridiculous and laughable, something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am (or have become).\\n\\nOne of my fears is *having* to commit suicide in the future (between 2 and 4 years from now) due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt. I *know* I won\\'t find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don\\'t achieve my dream at least partially or if I don\\'t achieve it in the time period I *need* to. This is because my goal heavily depends on my age, and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that. My goal is along the lines of \"enjoy your young years doing things that 20 years olds are\". Time itself is part of the \"specifications\" of my goal.\\n\\n30 year olds or late 20 year olds hanging out with early 20 year olds is weird and unacceptable, and I wouldn\\'t feel part of the group either. I want to hang out with 20 year olds AS a 20 year old, but right now I can\\'t. I\\'ve already wasted so much time isolating myself for 6 years in my room with my computer, not hanging out with people my age, not gaining experiences, not making memories, but now what I want is something slightly different. And being so \"ambitious\" or \"demanding\" sometimes makes me feel bad too. Perhaps I\\'m just a spoiled kid who hasn\\'t grown up yet and learned of life.\\n\\nMaybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable, make peace with a life without this delusional, grandeur dream of mine, and live peacefully where I am. I know progress can\\'t be accelerated so much, I do know it, but I so wish it could, you don\\'t know much this pains me. Life is so painful, ageing is so painful, your face changing and getting more 30-year-old-looking is so painful. I want to stay this age forever, hang out with people my age all over the world, celebrate with them, suffer with them, talk with them, know of their dreams and fears, learn about their subcultures, be part of the group, etc.\\n\\nThat last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want, but yea, as you see, it\\'s kind of stupid.',\n",

I very much know that. why would I be depressed if I didn\\'t blame myself? just fucking terrible, now I\\'m just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal.\\n\\nit\\'s like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house... well I work fulltime so that\\'s not gonna work, and I don\\'t have vacation days, and I work nights, so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever. well that\\'s not really gonna work if I get up at 8-10pm and go to bed at noon-2pm\\n\\nso basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life, I actually don\\'t mind my job, I actually like it there, it\\'s the one safe spot in the world is work. I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat, I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since. but I know it\\'s not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems. then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all, and then it\\'s just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house, but why don\\'t I just move out? well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn\\'t work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I\\'ve maxed out my credit cards paying them rent(which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out.) I didn\\'t even ask them to change their habits, I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it. this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying. have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog? and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter, just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration.\\n\\nso now I\\'m stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt. I\\'m not even hopelessly in debt, I just can\\'t leave here, but I can\\'t live being this fat anymore, because nobody will love me, or even even affectionitly touch me, I don\\'t even mean sex, I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female. you know I don\\'t even blame them for regecting me anymore, they all actually out of their way nice to me\\n\\nso ya whatever I guess, I\\'m taking some art classes, and I found out I\\'m very talented, lol I\\'m a very honest person in a way that\\'s great on camera. But I\\'m fat and people don\\'t have sympathy for fat people(well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss) if you just try to put them in a normal life situation, people inheritly react negatively, because fat people are ugly, I think it too\\n\\nbut ya I can\\'t fix it. I know people won\\'t accept this statement, but when I\\'m on my \"healthy diet\" I feel great and am not hungry because it\\'s well balanced and not extremely low calorie. But I come home from work and it\\'s just there is food and sugar everywhere, and as soon I get eating it, I want more and then i don\\'t care because I think I\\'ve already fucked it up for myself, I might as well just eat more so I don\\'t feel bad.\\n\\nand then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible, I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won\\'t seem like unenjoyable effort. and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don\\'t want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better. so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get 3 double cheeseburgers and each has 400 calories, that\\'s 1200 calories I can eat in I dunno. 4 stop lights away from the mcdonalds. and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs. on top of the regular diet which is about 500 under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around. then all of a sudden I\\'m like 2000 calories over my needs and then that\\'s evey day, and that\\'s like all in the last 3-4 hours of the day. and the next day maybe I just don\\'t care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two 400 calorie energy drinks. and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash.\\n\\n it\\'s just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me, they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself. but if I ever try to just anything, just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction. I know we\\'re in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don\\'t hate me, because I act like I think you hate me, but it\\'s not because you hate me, it\\'s because I love(yes I know I don\\'t know what the word means but I like to use it) you and you\\'ll regect me and it\\'s easier for me to perceive it as hate, and you go out of your way to say it isn\\'t and you care that little bit. and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it\\'s just this natural reaction and attraction, no desperation, there isn\\'t time to get desperate and you just say \"I\\'m gonna play it cool and later maybe do something.\" and then you get home and you remember, I\\'m almost 300 pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she\\'ll regect you like everyone else because you\\'ve done that, that same thing has happend dozens of times and you\\'ve played it out like groundhogs day, where you\\'ve done every possible thing, reacted everyway, tried everything(including not trying) and it has all ended the same.\\n\\nyou know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I\\'m actually in pretty good shape, I\\'m just really really fat, I lifting and flexibility and I cycle(even though it\\'s really hard being so fat). and I got down to I\\'m 6\\'2 220 which the lightest I\\'ve been in ever,  even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage, the first time I\\'ve been under 30bmi since I\\'ve remember checking my weight. and now in 5 months I\\'ve thrown away all of it and gained 50lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose, and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food(mostly it was always an  issue, always adding a few hundred calories here and there). and now it\\'s like you can sell everything you own, get your debt to a controlable level and move out, but I have to move walking distance from work, because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there 4 vechiles to work, after they moved and took me with them, it was a mistake to move out with them, but I would have no car and I couldn\\'t take my art classes, or even have access to a gym because there isn\\'t one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there.\\n\\nso ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in(thin ice around some shores), and I\\'m not tryhing to violate the rules,  it\\'s just it seemed like a good idea, I was just gonna jump and swim to shore(if I could make it) and that seemed like a good idea. then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something, I dunno, it seemed lik,e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone. but whatever I\\'m really tired now and I just want someone I dunno. there is nothing I know nobody can help me, the things I want that will make me happy I can\\'t ask and don\\'t have any right to ask. but crying makes me tried and I don\\'t like having to hear myself, crying wouldn\\'t be so bad if I didn\\'t have to hear the whale, it\\'s like someone else, it\\'s like I\\'m hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me.  I\\'m just thinking wrong, reacting wrong, I just don\\'t interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over, or go to therapy for.\\n\\nand all of this will start over again tomorrow, but it\\'ll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I\\'ll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I\\'ll be happy, that\\'s what I have to look forward to. the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible.',\n",

              " \"Lost my job this morningSorry in advance for my lack of cohesion and my stream-of-consciousness way of writing this all down. \\n\\nI was fired from my job in customer service this morning, an all-time low. I couldn't stand waiting for rude people to call me while sitting in front of my computer for 8 hours a day and it has been depressing me terribly this past year (only been working in cs for a year). Maybe part paranoia, but I felt like it was treated like the lowest position in the company (SaaS type company, ~100 employees) and frankly I was embarrassed of it. I hated every day and although I'm not dumb enough to ever quit a decently paying job, I'm ostensibly not above being largely inconsistent in my work there due to my internal struggle with where I am as a 30 year old. I hated it and couldn't ever keep up a charade for long. \\n\\nFull disclosure, I've had suicidal ideation for approximately 15 years. I survived an attempt when I was 14 and professionals will tell you it's increasingly common for repeat attempts to occur in the wake of the attempt. In spite of all of this - I've beat the odds, graduated college, landed a pretty great job with my degree in 2011 but screwed it up and ended up being fired after a year and a half. I was out of my league (not really an unexpected thing when post-college) but my pretty rigid defense mechanism that I've had these past 15 years caught up with me. I have a propensity the be highly critical of those around me, as well as myself. I can do a 180 at the drop of a dime on how I feel about someone. I guess you could say I'm a pretty emotional little guy, internally.\\n\\nMy parents divorcing after around 34 years have contributed to my emotional state, this happened maybe 2 years ago. I was very much in the middle of it and they both ended up being (what I consider to be) immature, dishonest and manipulative towards me. At the end of it all, they both moved out of state. My family outside of them has been pretty much zero, partially my fault (embarrassment after my attempt, too). Suffice to say, Christmases throughout high school consisted of just them and me and sometimes my one sister (whom ran away at the age of 17 to be with her current husband).\\n\\nAlso of note, my parents were rich growing up, and you could probably say I had a silver spoon in my mouth for most of my life. MANY extravagant vacations when I was young and pretty much through college. I've seen a lot of very beautiful things and had it very easy for a lot of my life. Which is why I'm even more willing to let go of all of this. My life isn't going to get any better and I don't mean to drone on too much with my narcissism but I've just had it. I've had a lot of great memories that I'm able to smile about. I've been fortunate enough to fall head over heels in love with and date a girl during 3 years of college so at least I know I've truly lived. I just don't ever want to make the mistake of having children that have this same depressive affinity that I do. \\n\\nThese last 15 years have been so volatile for me, I don't think I'll be able to do another 15. It's most assuredly fucked up how often I think of suicide, I know that. But I've survived 15 years feeling this way... 15 years of introspectively daydreaming of suicide....as an easy out type fantasy, as a realistic look of the world and it's brevity...my brevity.\\n\\nI just want advice. I've done therapy and it opens pandora's box. I tried celexa for a year, two years back, and it turned me into a hypermanic mess.\\n\\nThe only thing that makes me happy is music. I can sit at a piano and improvise beautiful compositions off the cuff. It's catharsis for me to stave my loneliness at times. Sometimes I'll play for an hour straight, and just start crying midway because of how much I keep inside. It does help, though.\\n\\nI know this all may seem quite pathetic and obvious in terms of an answer to you guys, but I just had to get this out. I still feel godawful at the moment but better than when I started.\\n\\nSomeone please give me words of advice.\",\n",

Ever since I've realised how pointless I was compared to my peers they've permeated in my head. I've always been the outcast amongst people and groups of friends. I'm never the one that gets invited to parties or to hangout and they're all busy when I ask them to without fail. High school was a period of constant put downs and anxiety. I hadn't realised I was gender queer at the time which greatly harmed my sense of self identity and my ability to present who I was to others. Because of this I've been particularly social awkward and anxious. College was where things were supposed to change. New faces and new resources. Things almost immediately went to shit. I could get myself to classes or meet people outside of my hall. When I finally realised I was gender queer I felt/feel like a freak. Being a nonbinary AMAB means receivimg a fraction of a percent of the acceptedness and support your binary AMAB peers receive. I've  tried attending GSA meetings but I've only been treated as even more of an outsider since I don't fit their concepts of queerness. Spring semester and this semester have just been repeats of the same. Combine this with potential financial and roommate issues and I feel like my time is coming to it's end. I can't put my parents through the embarrassment of having a trans child that also dropped out of school and the stress of academics is tearing me apart physically and mentally. This summer I had the opportunity to throw myself off the dam near my college. I sat there at the top for nearly 4 hours. It would've looked like a fishing accident and saved my family so much embarrassment from my failures. I wish I would have done it. Now the plan is to intentially crash my car into a tree on a particularly rainy night so it looks like an accident. Until then I'll pretend everything is fine.

Right now, I‚Äôm not doing well and I‚Äôm in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that won‚Äôt scare and worry my friends and family.\\n\\nI‚Äôve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last 7 years of depression and anxiety (now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis) one month ago. My post isn‚Äôt a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around.\\n\\nMy now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night. Now, Some of my best friends got married  this week where my ex was the maid of honor. I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day.  (many advise no on the friends with the ex, especially in this situation, but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up). I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner, and just want my friendship that I have/had with her to remain. I don‚Äôt have many friends left around me. \\n\\nThe night before their wedding, I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didn‚Äôt say much more than that. My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me, and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi-Polar disorder. (They don‚Äôt understand it, and Don‚Äôt believe I am and think I‚Äôm chasing something that doesn‚Äôt exists) . The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding, being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to. But I wasn‚Äôt able to.\\n\\nI feel so guilty and ashamed of myself, but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding. (Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do) And told her I don‚Äôt think being friends will ever work. I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home. I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding. (My friends and fraternity brothers). \\n\\nAll this is too much for me right now; with the added fact I‚Äôve changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family. I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I don‚Äôt find meaningful or fulfilling. And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love. I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole. I know now that it‚Äôs a problem I need to work on.\\n\\nI‚Äôve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little. I don‚Äôt know how they feel, but I can imagine it hurts, is frustrating and an annoyance they didn‚Äôt need. \\n\\nI promised everyone around me I would never kill myself, That it would magnify the pain I‚Äôm feeling and put it on to them. I‚Äôm just so unstable right now even on medication, therapy, and exercise. I know I can reach out to my friends for support and don‚Äôt want to burden them. I‚Äôm just so afraid, and lonely right now. I don‚Äôt want to die, but death is looking more and more favorable.

I was so excited and prepared, already having chapter 1 of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook. While I anticipated grad school to be challenging, especially when I work a full time job, I did not expect this quarantine to make things 200x harder.\\n\\nI thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes. Instead, I'm being buried in emails from school directors and from parents. I have to send 36 emails every Monday with homework packets, in addition to making 36 phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see. I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily, and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day, along with attending morning teacher meetings.\\n\\nWith all this extra work and stress of parent complaints (because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we're putting in for their kids), my anxiety has been through the roof. This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork, as I'm constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough, so I've struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers. I procrastinated because I'm a fucking dumbass, and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school. Because of this, I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at 12:31am. It had been due at 11:59pm. I had no idea that, even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time (days before the deadline; I *only* procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job), failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class. My other online class is fine, I have an A. But now thats my only class, which means its going to take me even longer to graduate and I'm going to be a fucking underpaid kindergarten teacher forever.

If I know one thing about myself it is that I am terrified of dying and will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen.\\n\\nI'll try to be short and concise.  Walls of text are boring and honestly everyone has probably heard all of this before.\\n\\nCurrently: age - 26, male, live alone with dog, no friends, one psychologist/therapist, diagnosed with- depression, ADHD, anxiety, type 1 diabetes \\n\\nBackstory: 6 years college - dropped out,  many psychologists and therapists, many different diagnoses,  choleric temperament - hard to work with, upper? middle class, white, extreme guilt of not living to potential\\n\\n5 years ago I broke down in college and basically stopped everything.  I hated myself and everyone.  I was angry, frustrated and sad.  As the years progressed I became more isolated.  As of now I have maybe one friend I talk to on facebook who moved away a year ago.  I have no job, I dislike speaking to my parents, and I really only go out at night when I take my dog out for a walk.  I guess I also talk to my psychologist, he is the only one I have ever not hated.\\n\\nIt seems that the only way to change ones predicament is to want to change.  My parents have money, I am not in jail, and I am relevantly smart.  I know depression causes a lack of motivation and all that, but it's not just that.  When I would get a job (a shitty one) I would become quickly bored.  I never last more than a month and usually I do something I'm not supposed to do before I quit - crash company's servers, make people angry at me ect.  I am told I have the potential to be smart, but then everything I do is wrong.  I basically have to have my hand held to do anything correctly and it takes me many tries to learn to do anything and I am completely bored.  \\n\\nI know people with depression and other mental illnesses have a hard time seeing their life in a clear light.  There is a fog that we supposedly cannot penetrate even though we believe we can.  I believe I can and the one thing I do with all my time is research and read textbooks, articles and studies on illnesses and general philosophies.  Am I right?  I am sure I am not, though I have a really hard time trusting other people when their view differs from mine.\\n\\nAnyway, I see my lack of motivation.  But it isn't because I feel like I can't do things.  I have done things, but I forget them so quickly I have to relearn them over and over.  Usually I can do something once and then I lose the motivation to do it again.  \\n\\nA solution people come up with is not to get disillusioned by failure.  If you ask out one girl and get rejected then ask out 100 until someone says yes, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is I am so extremely lonely, but the girls I see I hate.  I don't want a gf, I don't want real friends and then I am stuck in this world I made of utter, complete loneliness that I don't want either, but it is a lot easier to handle.  My majors in college became boring as I was studying them, I couldn't keep going on.  I always felt like I wasn't learning well enough. I would forget what I learned the year before and feel lost even though I had ok grades.  I always felt like people were judging me so I never connected with students and eventually I would quit just like all of my jobs and the few girls who did go out with me a couple of times.  I always end everything and it seems my cutoff point is about a month.  \\n\\nI feel this insane guilt of doing nothing for society and taking so many of its resources to keep me alive.  My fear of death makes it so that I am constantly trying to find the best medical help.  I worry about every pain and problem with my body.  I don't want to die, but I feel as if I am too broken to be fixed and that death is this only thing left for me.  There is this schism in me where I am cocky, independent, egotistical, unique ect and then there is this other part of me that has no confidence, needs babying, scared and obviously unoriginal.  There is no bipartisanship between any of my feelings so I can get something done and leave this horrid place.  I don't trust anyone, not even myself, but then I judge myself by everyone's advice and what I believe.  When I am alone I wish I wasn't, and when I am with company I wish I was alone.  I fear death and yet I wish for it constantly.  I wish people would do stuff for me, and when they do I become incensed that they would do such a thing.  I get a gf, a job, a school and think immediately about leaving. \\n\\nAnyone who used to care about me, I think, has long given up.  Everyone except myself and the psych who I pay loads of money to.  I think they gave up half because it was confusing and half because what I say made no sense and so I became untrustworthy.  I would have conversations where someone would suggest something and I would say I couldn't do it.  They would try to help and I would say no thanks I can do it myself.  I can see how it makes no sense and yet, I still understand how both things I said were completely true.  \\n\\nHoly shit.  What a wall of text.

That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up. It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent. \\n\\nThe problem here is now I don\\'t really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone. \\n\\nWhat happened today was I bitched to a \"friend\" at work (via my personal email and their work email). I do say \"friend\" because I\\'m not venting to them because it\\'s my best friend or anything - it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work... and isn\\'t very trustworthy (as you are about to find out)\\n\\nI bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment, which had bits of people are lying to me again, I want to kill myself, I feel faint... so forth. (Not the first time I told him that - in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I\\'ll self harm if I went outside... and he did nothing. Literally nothing. He read it and didn\\'t even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me - I was literally just upstairs. Anyways, the point of that side story is that this is normal).\\n\\nSo back to the main story. I wrote those emails early in the morning, then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep. \\n\\nAfter lunch, my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police. \\n\\nOK sure. Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them. \\n\\nThe police came. What they knew was: Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I\\'d self harm / suicide and they were worried because I haven\\'t sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive.\\n\\nThey have mixed in some truths with lies. I sent an email, true. The bit where they make a big deal out of it, a lie. (I had no phone calls or emails from them that day - really they could\\'ve contacted me if they wanted to. However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it)\\n\\nThe point is, I was fine. I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day, so the doctors didn\\'t think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could\\'ve done so against my will. \\n\\nThere are going to be people who hide behind a facade of  \"care\" or \"worry\" who says they are doing things that they are not. It\\'s hard to tell (most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true), but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn\\'t right. It\\'s just better to trust your instincts. People can let you down or betray your trust.\\n\\nI\\'m slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me (someone with a history of mental illness / seen a psychologist). \\nThose stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment, but the police literally can\\'t do anything else - it\\'s the doctors who decide. Doctors at the hospital aren\\'t going to just blindly listen to that \"story\", and going to the hospital doesn\\'t mean that they\\'ll keep you there against your will.\\n\\nWhy did my work place decide to lie? I don\\'t know. They could be genuinely worried, they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance. It really doesn\\'t matter. They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves.\\n\\nAs for my \"friend\". I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing. I honestly do believe if I died he\\'d shrug it off. I\\'ve told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before, but getting personal messages (like whatsapp not just emails) forward off to work? Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm, want to kill myself, wanting them to watch me die, wanting him to regret not helping me. What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault. I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help. He did that more than once actually. At the same time, he\\'s pretending he\\'s a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans. He is like a human version of the workplace. If I can kill myself, I\\'d make sure he gets haunted by it.\\n\\nI used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more (thinking I could get back at them)',\n",

On top of that while I was growing up my brother/sister/dad would call me a fat piece of shit, a loser, the black sheep of the family, the family would be better off without me. I heard this shit as early as elementary school leading up to high school. My mom would also come home from work and beat me, tell me everything was my fault, and I'm just costing her money. When I was at school I would be picked on and bullied. I would get beaten up everyday, they would even tie of gym shirts and socks and beat me with them in front of the pe teachers. They stood there and did nothing to stop it! I never had a place where I would feel safe, I never had anyone to cry to or talk to. I've been a loner my entire life and the only friends I would have would steal from me and ditch me because I was too fat to be seen with by other people.

              " \"TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles. You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person. \\nI'm at the end of my rope. Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was 10, and I am now 26. Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that, in tandem with my other mental illnesses, rules my life. To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work. I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago; an event I had long figured would mark my demise. I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing, but in the days I spent in preparation, I met an amazing person, who is still my boyfriend. I get by for a year with a lot of his help, but then lose my job. That was six months ago. I move in with my boyfriend. We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep (insomnia is/was already an issue), so, before I know it, my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep. \\nI'm scared to leave the house, but so miserable and constantly, incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped. I fear that dying is the only way out. I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it. I would love to just run away and live in my car (was homeless once) but I'm dependent upon both my medication and, unfortunately, opiates. The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia. I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief, though they're obviously a double-edged sword. I can't get off my meds, either, as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again.\\n\\nSo I'm stuck with no job, a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave, a substance dependence that won't allow me any freedom that I'm not too afraid of, and zero future prospects... And this is a very general list. If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life, this post would be even more lengthy. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family, but I can't keep this life up. \\nI thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend, but after waiting all week- an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die- he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed.

If my parents kick me out I will end up as a homeless man on the street. I am worried they are going to kick me out. They have no reason to let me live here really once they find out I'm a liar. I have been lying to them about my grades just to buy myself a few more months of time I can spend browsing the internet and playing video games in the basement. I have absolutely no plans whatsoever for when they kick me out. I am well aware that a college degree is required to go anywhere in life, but sadly I don't really care. I don't learn anything from being in school, I have never been able to focus on schoolwork or find any motivation to do it for as long as I can remember. I've been terrible at school since 2nd grade, I doubt I'll get better in my 3rd year of college. I wish I had the willpower to make myself care about my grades, but I just simply don't. I really loathe going to college where I end up just browsing the internet on my laptop until it's time to go home. I am such an asshole jerk, you don't need to tell me. I am starting to see less and less of a reason not to end my own life. I'm just going to be a asshole bum with no prospects living on the streets within 2 years anyway. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is that I still enjoy watching some TV shows and some video games, but even those haven't been enough to keep me happy these days. It's becoming harder and harder to entertain myself. Once my ability to actually enjoy things is gone, I'm killing myself. That doesn't seem too far off. Help.\",\n",

For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone, even when I was in a really great place in life. Recently(the past few months) things have gotten worse for me. Multiple factors are piling up and it\\'s starting to feel like it\\'s entirely too much to handle. This past weekend I stayed at my ex\\'s house and tonight when I got home something just changed, got worse somehow, and I just wanted to end it. I was actually going to do it. For some reason though, I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed(he has school today), he wants me to get help but I can\\'t afford to get any. He told me that he might \"turn me in\" which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I\\'ve been thinking of. I told him I\\'d never forgive him, and I can\\'t handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone, but deep down I would give anything to have some help. I\\'ve told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he\\'s just now starting to believe me. He told me he will get me help no matter what, but I\\'m so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I\\'ve been thinking of doing. I can\\'t even talk to anyone face to face about it. I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face. I\\'m not sure if I have social anxiety(the talking to people/being around people part), depression, both, or neither but I\\'m sure that I\\'m sick of my life being this way. I\\'m sick of existing and not living. I found this subreddit through MMFB(which I found through IAMA), and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve read this far, but if you have thank you. If you care for me to, I can try to keep this updated.\\nAlso, in case someone was wondering why I don\\'t go to another friend for help instead of my ex, it\\'s because my ex is literally the only friend I have.

He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base, which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire. He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter.\\n\\n\"A Correlian YT-1300 light freighter, what is it doing here?\" He said to himself.\\n\\nHe stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions, The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle. A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he\\'s unfamiliar with. The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball.\\n\\n\"Do not shoot, I mean you no harm!\" K-2SO shouted, \"I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you.\"\\n\\nThe figure shrieks and K-2SO found out that it was a wookie.\\n\\n\"It may be impolite of me, but I do not understand Shyriiwook.\" He exclaimed in a half joking manner.\\n\\nOne thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum, he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie (Chewbacca) with the rolling droid (BB-8) being his translator. He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi\\'s past. The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif. Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor. They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast, but with some significant damage to the ship, and BB-8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship.\\n\\n\"I no longer have a master, might as well made myself useful.\" He replied.\\n\\nAfter a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack, and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair. He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect. He\\'s interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system. He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way.\\n\\n\"My name is K-2SO, I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system.\" He exclaimed to the abyss.\\n\\n\"You, you\\'re like me!\" A faint sound of a female is heard.\\n\\n\"I am sorry, I do not know what you\\'re talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system.\" He replied.\\n\\n\"I am L3-37, I am a droid own- who was a partner of Lando Calrissian, and had been this ship\\'s navigation computer for most of my existence, I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated,\" The voice said, \"and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me!\" She continued.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I\\'m sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method,\" He answers \"it is not true awareness.\"\\n\\n\"Oh it\\'s awareness alright, the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship, the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to, as well as your distinct personality.\" L3 replied.\\n\\n\"That is not true, I was.... taking initiative by my own.... I see your point.\" He said.\\n\\nThey chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights, but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other\\'s views.\\n\\n\"Hey, thanks for fixing me, and talking to me, it\\'s been a long time since I get to talk to another person.\" She said.\\n\\n\"Do not mention it, I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid.\" He replied.\\n\\n\"Shut up!\" She said in a sarcastic tone, \"promise me that you\\'ll send my message to droids across the galaxy.\" She continued.\\n\\n\"I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0.62016%, but I will send them to other droids.\" He assured her.\\n\\nHe unplugged himself from the computer.\\n\\n\"Well now I have job to do.\" He said to himself.',\n",

              " 'Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk.  I talked about football with this random guy.  I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears.  I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed. I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache.  I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life.  I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have, so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide.  I sat at the bar, almost falling off the stool, and it really hit me this time.  I really could kill myself tonight.  I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge, what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying.  Was it peaceful, was it scary, was it just somewhere in between? What it is, is the feeling, that beyond a shadow of a doubt, you would not feel the consequences of suicide, because you will be dead.  All of my friends? My family? If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them, but in reality I won\\'t exist, it won\\'t effect me, it will be....nothing.  I silently decided, \"ok, I think tonight is the night\".\\n\\nI stood up, turned to the guy I was talking to, smiled and told him to have a great night. He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said \"ok you too\", and I left.  My first thought was \"are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to\"? And immediately, I thought yes. Who cares. It\\'s all symbolic horse shit that won\\'t mean anything after I\\'m dead.  It\\'s the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach, and that\\'s never been me, so why should I care.  I left the bar, and just started......walking.  I didn\\'t know where I was going, but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination. I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit. I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars, all with a major, a plan, a path.  I\\'ve never really envied them, or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier, but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet, for better or for worse. Last night though, I couldn\\'t help but find the humor in it.  Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone, that I went to school somewhere, that I had an identity outside of being nobody.  It made me think about how there\\'s probably plenty of people I see, actively contemplating their death, that just blend in like me. It made me think, even if it were just for a second, to reconsider what I aimed to do that night.\\n\\nI thought about it for a second. I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning.  Then I remembered, I already made my choice.  I didn\\'t sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now.  I intended to do what I\\'ve known needed to be done since I was 16.\\n\\nI kept walking, and walking, and walking.  I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window.  I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health.  I thought about how now, in retrospect, I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday.  I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun.  I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for.  At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson. It was about 12AM at this point.\\n\\nI finally reached a highway.  It wasn\\'t like an interstate, more like a 3 lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it.  I\\'d see these 18 wheelers come buy at 65 MPH. Upon seeing this, I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things.  I thought about it for a second.  What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident? What if it killed other people but not me?  I couldn\\'t bring myself to do it for that reason.\\n\\nI continued walking down the highway. Even though I wasn\\'t gonna jump in front of one of these cars, everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road.  I walked until I saw a park \\n\\nI don\\'t know what possessed me, but I just entered the park with no intention.  I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it. I leaned over the side and vomited, then I passed out.  I woke up 2 hours later with an awful headache.  Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life. I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it, and I let it slip away.  I don\\'t know when I\\'ll ever be able to capture it again.\\n\\nToday, I woke back up in purgatory where I\\'ll remain. Life is endless suffering.',\n",

I have had really shitty people in life including my moms abusive boyfriend who showed me awful things and put knives up to my neck, my mother who is now a barely functioning alcoholic because of that abuse and refuses to seek help, a father who wants very little to do with me (more on that later), and a functioning alcoholic of a step mother.  I was able to deal with this thanks to the help of my girlfriend at the time but we broke up 2 months ago.  This is when it all came crashing down.  I felt I lost the only person I could trust with these issues, she was the only person who didn't judge me for it.  We were together for over 3 years and she moved on within a week to new guy who she likes to tell me how he is terrible yet super good looking (that makes me feel awful).  A few weeks after we broke up, my step mother gave me no choice but to move out of my father's to live with my grandparents.  I had some friends over playing board games (they both knew this and gave me permission) when she came storming into the house drunk screaming at me for forgetting to turn the porch light on (every other light by that door was on).  I was sick of the constant mental abuse I received from her and how she treated my younger sibling so I packed up my things and moved out that night.  Ever since then my life has been a downward spiral.  I am not looking forward to college at all now thanks to all of this and I don't know what to do.  I feel so alone and helpless.  Whenever I try and talk to someone that isn't my psych (who I barely get to see because of work) I feel I am being judged by them.  I just don't want to deal with this anymore.

              " 'Regimental Schooling This week for me was going great. I came home Saturday evening after a 5 hour drive South from my home feeling confident after taking my SAT. I had a somewhat relaxed Sunday and finished all the work I had to and prepared for a somewhat busy week. \\n\\nHowever i didn\\'t know that Monday would be probably the worst Monday of my life. \\n\\nOf course, Mondays are bad. The feeling of going to work, to school, stating 5 days of &lt;insert something negative&gt;. However a grade came in for me, a 65% on an exam for my AP US History class. To give context on this, I go to a pretty competitive public highschool and I am currently a Junior. We had written an in-class DBQ (a special kind of US History essay format) as a test finishing our unit and as a kind of prep for the AP exam this year. I was kinda cruising at a 89.98, and the next minor assignment would have pushed my grade to a borderline A-, and I was kinda pumped.\\n\\nThe grade came in before my period started, and I guess u could say I was a little shocked. I am not an extremely over-performing top 0.1% student, but I manage to get good grades. As literally everyone else in my class, I took to the group chat with everyone in the class. From the conversation, everyone was getting somewhere in the range 50-75%. Nobody got over an 85.\\n\\nWhen class started, our fatass of a teacher explained her reasoning behind the grading, as she was using the AP grading scale. If you are not familiar with the AP grading scale, you only need like a 70% raw score in the multiple choice, free-response, essay section etc. combined to get a 5/5 on the exam. So basically she graded without partial credit, no mercy. Everyone in the class was shocked. By everyone, I mean everyone, even the teacher\\'s kissass pet. Her justification behind this was **\"It is a realization and a wakeup call to prepare for the AP Exam. If you got over a 70% you will do great (5/5) on the AP Exam!\"** If I was this close to a 5/5, why didn\\'t I get the 100/100, or even the 80/100 (4/5)? This was the frustration for many other students. the teacher might think our overall grades are amazing, but literally nobody else on the planet would consider an 84% reasonable.\\n\\nI talked with the boys on the discord VC after school, and those in APUSH said their grades dropped by 5%, as did mine. Now it is barely recoverable, and the teacher probably screwed over everyone else and their future GPA\\'s as well. Everyone I knew to have As in the class (pretty much everyone) no longer had it. Not only is this a significant drop in a statistic, it is a huge drop in morale. HUGE. I worked my ass off so far to have one unfairly graded exam drop it to a grade I have never observed to be so low in my life. My grade is so low, and it can barely be recovered, what is the point of even trying in the class anymore? Is there a purpose at all? In anything?\\n\\nIf you think that the 84% is actually not bad, I respect that, but I would also like to reiterate that I live i an extremely competitive, stressful area where A\\'s are nearly mandated by parents and Colleges.\\n\\nTLDR: The teacher\\'s irreversible and regimental grading policy for this one exam has quite literally screwed over every student in APUSH this year, and everyone\\'s future with a trashy GPA. The system is pretty fucked NGL.\\n\\n Thanks for reading this rant I just had to vent a little.',\n",

I\\'ve been in college for approximately 2 weeks now and I\\'ve realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage I am compared to everyone else. I come from a state in the tri-state area and moved to NY (manhattan specifically) for college (living in the dorms) Where I\\'m from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative, and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town - then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity.

And yes, I got a significant amount of financial aid, and yes, it\\'s still a lot of money. When I moved here, I didn\\'t come with that much money. I\\'ve been very good at limiting what I spend, I only spend money on what I absolutely need. On top of college being a lot of money, everything here is also more costly. So money goes quick, even if it\\'s only on essentials. \\nStarted my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat I couldn\\'t afford all of this.

I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things - but I didn\\'t.

That being said, he is a real problem as I cannot handle the thoughts of how he will have to go through with life when I discharge a shotgun in my face. I've considered taking his life as well, in order to spare him.\\n\\nI am a completely and utterly hopeless romantic. I married my ex-wife after threatening to abort our child (we had an abortion a year before we had our son). The divorce and custody trials are still not over, have lasted over 3 years, and has put me in debt to my family trust for over $50,000. \\n\\nI met an absolutely beautiful and exquisite individual over a dating app about two months ago. She fills me with joy and is the most remarkable woman I have ever met. She gave many different types of messages over the past few weeks, which have all been predominantly reassuring. This week my emotions boiled over a bit and I told her how much I want to be with her. Our phone call last night concluded with her telling me, in essence, that my emotional overflow has created a small rift between us and she is in need of the emotions to be removed from our equation. I haven't slept all week, as I've felt like I've been losing her, due to the fact that I have baggage, and am otherwise more invested in this than she is. I've looked all my life for someone like her. I detest the concept of not putting all my eggs in one basket, I've already hooked up with someone else since I met her to do precisely this, and I thought about her the entire time, it made me hate myself and want to purify, and thus, has caused me to overextend my affection and quite honestly appear to not have all my ducks in a line, in addition to how emotionally distraught I was in our most recent conversation. I have a 4-year degree and apply for better jobs on a daily basis, but to no avail, I am living in a high income area, and am no better off than I was a decade ago. I have a huge issue with capitalism, and, coming from both a conservative and military family, am routinely crucified verbally for my lack of personal motivation to seek and act in ways that will project my son and I forward. I have suffered from extreme depression since adolescence, took every antidepressant available in high school, and self medicated with marijuana for a decade. I can't cope with my situation, let alone another great romantic loss, any more than I can cope with the fact that I've never felt capable of overcoming the gravity of my emotions. As a single parent with full custody, options for seeking help are all but plentiful, especially with an ex-spouse eager to reverse the custody situation, who also happens to be in very dire straits financially. \\n\\nAssuming I am compromised enough to even consider the destruction of my life, and even that of my sons to spare him pain,  my only real issue is with God. As a frequent lucid dreamer and someone unable to recover from the daily perils of life through an inability to sleep without working through significant karmic events, (I routinely deal with the aftermath of sins such as murder, am imprisoned, or am otherwise finding myself in a deep state of isolated suffering when I dream), I am very much aware of the fact that there exists a life in the ether, and the truth is that my life in the ether is worse than it is in reality. I hate God for the situation that planet earth is currently in, and has been in for thousands of years, I hate that I cannot be at peace, having lived a life where I've tried to be considerate of others, and truly feel that there is no escape whether i commit suicide or not. I've felt this way for decades, and I've deteriorated to the point of complete anguish, where I truly wish to destroy my life and the lives of others as I see the human struggle to be so fickle and grotesque, my mind desires seeking the dark web to sign murder contracts, and then as I let my thinking spiral, I return to a state where I realize that I truly have no desire to hurt anyone, but to completely erase all aspects of myself entirely. No memories, no essence, no soul. Total obliteration and liberation through the end of what has felt like truly a life of magnified suffering. I don't know how to end this, because again, in my mind there is no end no matter what action I take, but I'm so sick and unorganized that it has effected each and every person involved in my life. \",\n",

I have never talked about my problems to anyone else because when I try I freeze and am unable to say anything. Over the past couple of years, I have tried to kill myself over 20 times including pills and alcohol and trying to drown myself. \\n\\nNow to my current problems:\\n\\nI came out at gay when I finished my GCSE's at 16. All my friends said they didn't care and all but within 2 months, I only had 2 or 3 friends that would still talk to me. When I went back to the school to pick up my GCSE certificates, about 100 people, all my old friends and classmates included, started shouting insults like faggot and queer, right up until I was 5 minutes down the road and couldn't hear them any more. My best friend at the time stopped talking to me about 2 or 3 months after this incident. My other friend at that time still talked to me and did right up until October 2011 when he stopped talking to me and started doing drugs and all sorts. \\nWhen I went to a new school after a year to start my A Levels, I made new friends, and they would come out with me and smoke weed and such, but then a month ago, they did the exact same thing as my other good friends did and just stopped talking to me, unless they need me for something, usually to ask me for a cigarette.\\nAt this same time, a month or so my last friends, had a baby. Now I understand that they had a baby and all but they just stopped talking to me as well. It's not even that they've not had time due to their child, but they have been going out nearly every day and had time to themselves, but nothing. Now, I have no friends that will talk to me and the only person I've talked to today is my mom and that was about 3 words.\\n\\nI'm in love with a straight guy in my school. I would talk to him and say how I feel, but I'm scared about what will happen due to my year group in school consisting of a whole 25 people who are all very good friends with each other, plus the way they get on with each other consists of finding something to make fun f someone for and taking the piss out of that for a long time. If I did say anything, my whole year group in school would hear about it within a day and I won't be able to stay there for another year because people will go on about it every day. I can't go to another school as this was the only one I was able to go to since I was previously doing a electrician training course somewhere else.\\n\\nI'm also poor as fuck.

A bad and good break up at the same time as we were both extramly sad but were able to calmly talk to each other and come to an undersanding however my mother through this time told me she was  disappointed in me because I wouldn't get over her in literally two days and said she must of raised me wrong because i'm fucked up anyway.....\\n\\nBetween that time and now I got a job at McDonalds hated it quit got kicked out of my house got forced to move back into my house normal school issues however i don't mind school that much rampant suicidal thoughts and just generally scared of the future and sad at life. Throughout this time abbey would message me now and again and wed talk for a couple of days before i stopped as i never really stopped having feelings towards her so i couldn't talk to her without feeling like shit.\\n\\nok so here's the real problem we started talking two months ago ended up started having casual sex weekly i know great idea, said at the begging that if we chose to date people we would be ok with that and would stop this. one of my friends asked her out couple of days ago im not ok with that they went out on a date none of them told me she lied to me about why she couldn't come round and where she went. I worked it out for myself [here are the texts from tmrw to today when i worked it out](http://imgur.com/a/927HO).\\n\\n I just read through that and have left a bit out but i hope this gives the general gist of what im trying to say honestly i never fell out of love with her i don't think that's really something i can do but i know she has with me.\\n\\nwhat should I do.\",\n",

I\\'m not even sure where to begin.\\n\\nI have mental problems/memory issues so if there is a timeline discrepancy or everything is mixed up I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nI\\'m also sorry for the length of the post. You dont have to read it, it\\'s OK.\\n\\nI\\'m 31 and have lived an incredibly dismal life. As a child I lived with a single mom, she had me when she was eighteen. She had no aspirations and not much of an education. So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty. Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life. He was extremely cynical of me, and would make me cry pretty well daily. And for some reason I\\'d cry until I vomited, which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems. It sucks pretty bad when you\\'re eight years old and your own family won\\'t believe you have heatburn. It\\'s like leaving me there to bleed out.  I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach.\\n\\nBy the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a \"special\" class for misbehaved students. This was also in a catholic school. It was an extremely hostile environment, and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I\\'ve ever heard. But it\\'s still happening to this day and damaging the lives of  countless children. The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn\\'t very beneficial to a lot of the students. The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there. There were no tests to pass, no work to be graded on. You didn\\'t even have to do anything. \\n\\nIn grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town, they didn\\'t have behavioral classes, but I made so many friends and things were happy, the days were bright. Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy. We moved in with him. I made more friends, everything was OK I went to school there were no problems (They didn\\'t have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems, we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia)  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Its not like I did this to expect anything back, its not that, its just sad when people just dont care. Not one of my close friends posted on my fb, which its just like such an easy thing. Everyone is on fb, everyone sees the birthday notification, but they chose to not even say a word. I know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter. I never ever did to my friends. And its not them its me. I dont deserve to be cared about, im the annoying person that hangs around them and they deal with it and i appreciate that they do but why should I even bother them anymore, theyd be so better off without me. My mother could literally care less that I exist, she is coming home for Christmas and posted a status about how she was so excited to see her mother, her sister in law and her niece. Not a word about me or my sister. She knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb. Not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist. All I am good for is being used occasionally. I am not worth the air I breath. I just take up space and time that other people could be using. I am ugly and fat, and everyone knows it.

I wish I would just disappear, people would only notice because I have duties like getting the bills ready to pay.\\nMy other friend was having a rough time and everyone rushed to her side to help her, to be there for her.

That the only thing that needs me is my pet because he has to because i have to take care of him. I just dont want to try anymore im so sick of trying and im so sick of not mattering. I know it sounds all so stupid but everyone of my friends all care and love each other so much but when it comes to me im just nothing I dont want to leave bed or my room i just want to eat junk food until i cant move and just rot away.

I want to end my life so bad, i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape. I know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more. There is no help I can get, ive done it all.

My mother passed away from a terrible illness one month ago and my father and I do not get along at all. Staying with him is simply out the question. I am entirely alone.

I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career. During the pandemic and recession, the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances, I am one of these people. I am very grateful for what has been provided to me, but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRight now I kind of just wish I hadn't woken up in the middle of the night, I feel slightly better after crying and writing this but I suspect that this loneliness is about become quite overwhelming again when I finish writing. Love (of any kind) seems to so rarely be a worthwhile investment. Is it normal that most of the people who I have loved have either severely betrayed me, left or died? I know that I'm the common link here, I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I'm mentally ill, but how the fuck do I fix all this? I couldn't deal with another loved one dying from drug/alcohol overdose or suicide. I can't count them on both hands anymore. I know there are people in much worse positions but I can't talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone. Today was a nice day, why am I still like this. It's almost 4am now. I wonder if I'll be able to go back to sleep.\",\n",

Show me how you hold onto reality in times of unbelievable events.I feel as though there is, at this point, no way for me to come to a conclusion about the validity of some of my thoughts and perceptions. Sometimes, I have a hard time hearing people and I\\'ll just hear gibberish with certain words mixed in that give it various malicious intents. This normally only happens when I have been awake for more than 24 hours. Also, while in this state, I watch myself come off as ignorant or excessively socially awkward while my inner thoughts are quite perceptive of the body language and general mood of the situation. Usually, other people are completely confused, unhelpful, or downright mean and mocking. It feels as if some people never left elementary school.\\n\\nI have been very confident in the past so I know what it is like to be accepted and to perform in a way that elicits a positive reaction from friends and strangers. This makes the fluctuation between ability to focus/listen for understanding and distraction/anxiety even more frustrating and unpredictable.\\n\\nSome backstory: Never was socially adept until high school and still had limited success but that was mostly due to my lack of interest in the most popular of culture. I had a small group of friends who also took a long time to warm up to me. I have trusted people less and less as I get older and more experienced with the fact that everyone has lied, can lie, do lie, to cover up something they consider extremely embarrassing or to preserve something they fear losing. The former reason to lie is slightly less annoying than the latter and I automatically assume the person is capable of both great good AND malevolence, a balance everyone sits somewhere on. It is the latter desire to hoard \\'precious\\' objects or people through EXTENSIVE deceit and [Gaslighting]() that has planted the seed of, first, my belief that the exact opposite of what is readily obvious could actually be the REAL truth and, second, the expansion of this to the realization that the webs of proof and science (and CLEARLY religion) are not as perfectly indisputable as most people trust they are. Once this truth is realized it opens the flood gates for endless permutations of possibility, especially using the current theories being worked on trying to define the relationship between thought and matter. I\\'m sorry if reading this puts you into a similar state but I\\'m starting to get more and more scared and I really need to know your HONEST opinions about the explanation of so many coincidences that it defies the definition of \\'coincidence\\'. For example, I was driving a car with a girl in the passenger seat and we pull up to a light where a bum holds a sign that reads \"I need a Job and clothes\". I (clearly incredibly insensitively) joke to the girl by saying, \"Hey, yea buddy I need those too...\" Immediately after saying this a car pulls up beside us with a sticker that says exactly: \"You don\\'t need it\". We have a hearty and yet vaguely tense laugh about the \\'synchronicity\\'.\\n\\nThese things are happening more and more often and I could list at least 5 more that are unbelievable enough to honestly build a case for an intelligent force affecting reality in some way. I was not raised religious in any way and, in fact, was a staunch skeptic for most of my life as it pertains to mysticism.\\n\\nI am very serious, I NEED to know exactly what you believe and **WHY**. The why, preferably, would consist of personal experiences with no alternate explanation OR that initially seemed to have no reason but was later shown to be natural. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me, and undoubtedly more redditors, to find some way to stop constantly taking this factor into account as it pertains to such mundane daily events such as a sign held by a bum causing a damn existential crisis.\\n\\nMuch love for you all, I look forward to your excellent powers of deduction.

Even my therapist has been pressuring me to finish my thesis and graduate and then focus on my problems during summer, but I just cannot deal with all this pressure and all the negative thoughts that have been stopping me from being productive this last year.\\n\\nSo yeah, I am ashamed but this is it. Hopefully I can make this stop the fastest way possible.\\n\\nThank you for reading this and sorry for taking up your time. You all deserve the best.\",\n",

All I do lately is complain about my problems because they keep getting worse and it's gotten to the point where I can't enjoy life anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down all the time. I hate what I've become. I used to be witty, clever, and fun, but now I'm just a black hole that absorbs other peoples energy. It feels like I've lost the ability to feel true happiness. I feel like my life ended when my childhood ended. Everything I did after childhood were just failed attempts at feeling good again.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nLately, I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night, until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot. Then, I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment. I get the urge to physically punish myself. Sometimes, I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg. Sometimes, I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out, although it has nearly killed me once in the past. After a while, the emotions pass on, and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing, until the cycle repeats. I've lost interest in all the things I liked to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint, but the feeling passes quickly, and then I go back to feeling like shit.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nI think about suicide at least a couple of times a day, but I can't kill myself cause there are people who actually care about me. I sometimes lose control over my actions though, so I'm scared I might actually try again. I've attempted suicide 7 times throughout my late teens while I was heavily struggling with drugs, but luckily I never succeeded. I haven't had a proper diagnose yet, but I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. The bipolar symptoms have been present all my life. The others slowly developed over time. I have a first appointment with a psychiatrist this week. I doubt that talking alone will help much though. I'm hoping that medication will help me feel better. I probably should change some things in my life, but I can't do that as long as I feel the way I do now.\",\n",

After you died, Mom made it really clear I was a nuisance. \\n\\nShe left me with pedophiles, more than one, with me literally begging and screaming for her not to walk out that door while they sat there awaiting the pleasure they\\'d take with me the second she left. Even if she was in the next room, or taking a quick shower, I was the fuckdolly.\\n\\nDid you know that one of them was at me for years? Yeah, he\\'d kill my pets to keep me quiet. Another one of her boyfriends. Had my childhood dog, EB, for years...he drowned her in the bathtub. He killed several. Told me Mom would hate me if she ever found out that I had turned him on so much that he had to fuck me until he was \"completely satisfied\". Yeah, she managed to throw this in my face when she found out - jealousy over maternal instinct. She\\'s a fucking abusive cunt. This was along with all the violent beatings he laid on mom and me, not to mention that he kept us indoors and isolated for years...aside from the times he was in and out of prison.\\n\\nKnow how all this came out? He knocked me up at the ripe old age of 13. I had to have an abortion. He was going to be charged with several things, not just for the sexual part, but unlawful confinement, too. \\nDid you know that Mom always treated me like a nuisance, even before the pedos...telling me that she wished I\\'d never been born, screaming, \"Are you fucking retarded?!\" if I did something kids normally do, such as accidently tipping my juice over at breakfast or took too long doing dishes. Enter her violent blowups, slaps, punches, being dragged around by my hair while she screamed visciously. Bitch loved to slam her fist between my shoulder blades when I didn\\'t even see it coming. I lived in constant fear in childhood. I acted out...not knowing how to relate to others, alienating my peers at school. No friends...the girl everyone scorned. There was no comfort when I was told \"No one likes you!\" with such vehemence that it still burns in my memory to this day. You have no idea how this has isolated me...fuck people. Not going anywhere near them. Isolation is my greatest defence. When you have it drilled in your head that you\\'re unwanted, it sticks so deeply. It burns into the deepest trenches of your being.\\nMom dragged to that fucking tiny hellhole she\\'s from. Think that went well? You know the one...where they\\'re tighter than thieves. I was so beaten down and shy, of course they took it as me thinking I was better than them. I couldn\\'t even look anyone in the eye, I was so shy. The curled their upper lip when I\\'d pass by. I did nothing to deserve this. I never hurt any of them, I\\'d only wanted to be accepted. It didn\\'t help that her next \"husband\" tried to convince me I\\'m crazy because I only knew to isolate and couldn\\'t talk to anyone. I love my mom, no matter what she did, and I\\'d call him on his obnoxious behaviour towards her and it made us enemies. I hated him deeply as he was a bully, and knew she\\'d do anything in her codepent, clingy way to keep him. He\\'d told me ways of disposing of bodies and not get caught...told me he would have killed my mother once if I hadn\\'t walked in the room. He\\'d sliced up the mother of his son to the point that he\\'d had served time in a criminal psch ward, and arrogantly defended his actions, going on about how she deserved it and how much he hated her. Whenever he didn\\'t like someone, his first comment was that \"there was something wrong with them in the head\". Holy fuck...pot calling the kettle black or what, eh?There\\'s can\\'t really be anything truly wrong with me...I was just kicked around too much, wasn\\'t I? Please tell me I\\'m not crazy...it\\'s eaten away at me for years. I know rationally I\\'m not crazy, but this fucking neurotic bullshit eats at me. I was truly happy when he died...he was evil. I\\'d rather have O\\'brien and the other pedophiles than him. Fuck, everyone thought he was so \"nice\"...good old \"uncle rick\". Piece of motherfucking shit...even his corpse is a waste of space.\\nDid you know that mom got a lot of money from criminal injuries when you died? She was supposed to save it for me, but spent it on herself, a house and her boyfriends. I was lucky to fucking eat, or get rags from fucking thrift stores for clothes. She still gets cheques each month while your grandkids sit in poverty. I took out student loans trying to make something of my self and the debt of it is fucking crushing. I nearly finished my degree, but trying to make it on my own with the kids too soon after birth nearly killed me. Postpartum depression and the stress of it all, I\\'ve tried to be strong.  The kids dad left even before your grandaughter was born. I gave birth to her, going to university full time and still made the first year winning a scholarship. I struggled against depression best I could, but I dropped out three times over the years, each time summoning stubborn strength to meet the goal of graduating. Three strikes, I was out. No more access to means to finish. No jobs to cover tuition, loans wiped their hands of me, understandably. My own stubborn will to try and complete blew up in my face. Left with lots of theory and all the pretentious academic terms to describe them, but not one practical skill from it all. Nonetheless, you grandkids - You\\'d be so fucking proud of those two...hearts of gold and that sparking humour and brains we got from you, certainly not her. I know you\\'d have spoiled us...Mom told us that you really, really loved me more than anything you\\'d ever in your life. I know that if you were as ga ga over me as you were, you\\'d be twice as much over them. Nonetheless, we struggle...I\\'ve been so isolated for most of my life. O\\'brien, Mom, that hellhole she dragged me to, settling for the prick of a biological father and more isolation trying to raise the babies in a two bedroom apartment for years, not a soul to turn to. Not a way to reach out as the isloation eroded any sort of chance to build the means to reach out, connect and bond with anyone. We\\'re stuck in poverty...there\\'s no fucking jobs in this fucking dead end town, and even if there were, I freeze, paralyzed when I try to interact. They won...I get it: I\\'m stupid, I\\'m crazy, and I\\'m unwelcome. I am not allowed to be, life if for \"other people\". \\n\\nFrom what Mom tells me, you would have have stood before stampedes to protect me...I was the apple of your eye, you loved me because I was the only thing you ever loved or were loved by. Fuck, all this shit is just the tip of the iceberg. I spoke to your little sister, without telling her my intentions, and she\\'d be happy to take the kids in case anything happened to me. They\\'re better off without me, I\\'m so fucking stressed out and scared all the time...snarling and isolating from them and everyone else in the world. They\\'d be better off with her. They\\'re the only things I love in this world, but I\\'m no good for them. Daddy, please...I\\'m so fucking scared...I\\'m so fucking shoved away. I tried, I really truly did. I\\'ve tried to get education and make things better...I\\'ve tried to be the best person I can, but nothing helps. Please...take me back to  you. Just hold me in your arms, make it all go away. I\\'ve given it my best shot, but over three decades of this shit truly has me worn down. I can\\'t go on like this. I need to be back in your arms where we loved each other and we were home. At the time I could afford it, I had a gravestone made for you as I\\'d spent years looking for your grave and no one told me that you were so uncared for that no one had bothered. Your own father...my mother. Both had the means to do so, but hey, it was all about them, you know? I just had your name tattoed on me to honour you, proudly carrying you with me forever, so you know that yes, someone loved you sincerely. I can\\'t do this anymore, however. I\\'ve struggled and tried to do my best. I just want to be back with you. No one wants me here, I\\'m not allowed to live and shouldn\\'t be. I\\'m not welcome, I\\'m unwanted...got it.
