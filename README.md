# Suicidal-Content-Classification-using-Transformer-Based-Algorithms
The purpose of this study is the early detection of suicidal feelings to prevent a possible suicide attempt. This is achieved with the help of three Deep Learning Techniques (LSTM, BERT, and USE). The dataset used has a ‘text’ column that contains a variety of posts shared by the users and a labelled ‘class’ column that has 2 categories which signify whether the text is suicidal or non-suicidal. The NLTK has been performed for text data pre-processing and transformation that is further used to model the RNN-based LSTM, Transformer- based BERT, and the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) for suicide text classification. The transformer-based models have been implemented using various epochs and batch sizes to obtain optimal results. The transformer-based USE and BERT models produced more balanced performance metrics with an accuracy measure of 93% and 85% respectively.
